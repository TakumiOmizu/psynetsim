\usage{
simulate_treatment_network_dym(
  W_init,
  b_init,
  target,
  connectivity = 1,
  edge_between_TC = 1,

  TB = 1,
  trial = 10,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{W_init}{A square matrix representing the initial weighted connections (edges) between symptoms. The number of rows/columns determines the number of symptoms in the network.}

\item{b_init}{A numeric vector representing the initial thresholds (biases) for each symptom. Its length must match the number of symptoms in \code{W_init}.}

\item{target}{A list or vector indicating which symptoms are targeted by the treatment. Use 1 for targeted symptoms and 0 for non-targeted symptoms. Its length must match the number of symptoms.}

\item{connectivity}{A numeric value (default: 1) controlling the overall strength of connections within the network. Higher values increase the influence of connected nodes.}

\item{edge_between_TC}{A numeric value (default: 1) controlling the strength of connections between different treatment components (TCs).}

\item{weight_bias}{A numeric value (default: 1) influencing the weight of connections between treatment components and targeted symptoms. A value greater than 1 increases the negative (inhibitory) effect.}

\item{TB}{A numeric value (default: 1) influencing the threshold (bias) of treatment components. Higher values make TCs less likely to activate spontaneously.}

\item{trial}{An integer (default: 10) specifying the number of simulation trials to run. Results are averaged across trials.}

\item{baseline_iteration}{An integer (default: 10) specifying the number of iterations for the baseline (pre-treatment) simulation phase.}

\item{num_TC}{An integer (default: 5) specifying the total number of treatment components to be introduced.}

\item{TC_iteration_per_component}{An integer (default: 10) specifying the number of iterations after each TC introduction for the network to adapt, before re-estimation.}

\item{follow_up_iteration}{An integer (default: 10) specifying the number of iterations for the follow-up phase.}

\item{symptom_name}{A character vector (default: NULL) providing custom names for the symptoms. If NULL, symptoms will be named alphabetically.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\item{result_plot}{A \code{cowplot} object displaying two plots: a network visualization of the \emph{initial} symptom connections (which are dynamically updated during simulation) and a time-series plot showing the mean and standard deviation of symptom and treatment component activation.}
\item{result_text}{A character string summarizing the mean and standard deviation of symptom and treatment component activation at the final simulation step.}
}
\description{
\code{simulate_treatment_network_dym} simulates treatment intervention on a symptom network, where \strong{symptom network connections dynamically update} based on recent patient state data using regularized logistic regression (Lasso/Elastic Net), capturing how the system responds to treatment over time. This functionality is an extension of the base \code{simulate_treatment_network} function.
